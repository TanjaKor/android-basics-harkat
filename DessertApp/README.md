> This app is a part of Unit 3 in "Android Developers Android Basic in Kotlin"-course. An app that lets user to tap dessert on the screen to "purchase" it. In the original starter code  were some bugs that I had to fix with lifecycle methods so that the amount of desserts, total price of the purchase and the picture of dessert keeps the same even though the lifecycle changes (e.g. when rotating the screen or visiting other apps.)
