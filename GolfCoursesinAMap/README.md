> This app is isn't actually a part of any specific course, but I have heavily used "Add a map to your Android app" codelab. The idea of this app is from Android Application Development course in JAMK (which I haven't yet enrolled). But i have used also this courses material when building this app. I didn't want to do exactly the same as in Google Developers codelab, so I had to use more my own brains in this one.
The point of this app is that it takes information from JSON file (Golf Courses) and shows it in Google Maps with cutomized markers.
